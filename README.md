# Citrus Workshop

This repository contains the presentation and required demo files for the Kubernetes Workshop (2025 @ Citrus). See the [manifests](manifests/) directory for the Kubernetes demo files and [presentation](presentation/) for the source files used for the presentation slides.

## Presentation

The presentation is made with [Marp](https://marp.app). This tool can be installed locally and convert Markdown files to presentation slides. This allows for public availability of the presentation source and invites contributors to propose improvements.

After installing the `marp-cli` you can easily start the presentation (with auto-reload) with:
```sh
marp -p -w -I presentation
```

> **NOTE: The presentation is completely in Dutch**
